Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.
modular bot
Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.
ModularNodeBot
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/ModularNodeBot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.
